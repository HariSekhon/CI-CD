# All that's needed on GitHub Pages is this line
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman

# ==========
# Everything else from here on down is to get Netlify to behave similarly to GitHub Pages

# GitHub defaults to generating README.md -> index.html on GitHub Pages
# but on Netlify needs this extra config

#remote_theme: pages-themes/cayman@v0.2.0

plugins:
  # GitHub loads front matter automatically
  - jekyll-optional-front-matter
  - jekyll-titles-from-headings
  #- jekyll-remote-theme

# GitHub adds this with a link to the CI-CD repo, but outside GitHub Pages must add something ourself
